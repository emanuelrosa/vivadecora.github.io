<p>If you want to create a guest post that will appear as if written by another author, simply add an <code>author</code> attribute to the front matter of your blog post. This will be picked up in the template and displayed in the meta-section both on the front page as well as on the individual post pages.</p>

<p>This postâ€™s front matter looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Guest Posts</span>

<span class="s">author</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">George Michael</span>
  <span class="s">info</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">(@&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/georgemichael"&gt;GeorgeMichael&lt;/a&gt;)</span>

<span class="s">summary</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">If you want to create a guest post that will appear as if written by another author, simply add an `author` attribute to the front matter of your blog post.</span>
<span class="nn">---</span></code></pre></div>
